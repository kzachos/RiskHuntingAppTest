A resident with physical disabilities wishes to remain in bed until 12.30pm at
which time she will require support from two staff to get her up (which takes
about 40 minutes). Despite staff efforts to negotiate with her, she is adamant
that she will not be happy to be got up any later or any earlier than this time.
However, this is lunchtime in the home, and staff are all needed to support other
residents. If these two staff are taken away from the dining room, other staff will
feel pressurised and lunch will be less of a pleasant and relaxed occasion for other
residents. How do we resolve this? Why is this resident so fixed in her desire to get
up at a set time? Is there support that she needs? In the short term do we stop the
resident from getting up or do we stop other residents from getting to the table at
lunchtime?

      A tall male resident with dementia had walked across the lounge and was standing
over a slight female resident sitting in a chair. The male resident was scaring the
female resident, who, because of arthritis, had no means of escaping him.

A Care Quality Commission inspector arrived to do a key (unannounced)
inspection in a care home. On showing her round she immediately stated that the
care chairs (rollabout chairs) were inherently considered a form of restraint. These chairs enable 
residents to be sat up for short periods of time and to join other residents in communal settings. 
She hadn?t seen a single patient yet so had no idea about dependency or capability.
When the member of staff showing her round stated that the people who used
them would otherwise be bed bound, she simply reiterated her view that they
were inherently considered a form of restraint if you had any ability to weight
bear. The care home staff were concerned that her mind was made up before any
consideration of the circumstances. Inspectors do not always appreciate the appropriate use of 
these chairs.

      Miss Green, a resident experiencing late stage dementia, frequently lashes out at
staff (and even relatives) who are supporting her to get washed/eat/drink. There is
a risk both to the staff and to the resident herself. Every attempt has been made
to find creative ways to stop this behaviour: staff have tried different approaches,
tones of voice and routines, but the behaviour continues. External support and
advice has also been sought. The behaviour appears not to be an expression of
anger directed at any specific aspect of the environment or task being undertaken.

A resident is assessed to be at high risk of falling and lacking capacity to make
decisions. The resident is therefore encouraged to get up only with support from a
member of staff. This means that the individual may spend more time sitting than
they would wish, which in turn will lead to more muscle wastage and the longerterm
consequences of greater unsteadiness and risk in walking.

The decision to allow someone to walk around unsupported may have longer-term
consequences if they suffer a fall. One relative talked about how she didn?t want
her mother to get up and walk around unaided, not because she could fall, but
because the fall might lead to the resident requiring a spell in hospital. This relative
knew that her mother feared hospitals. A hospital stay would be highly distressing
and disorientating and could ultimately lead to her further mental deterioration.

      Mrs Charlesworth, a resident with dementia, shouts expletives at other residents
on a daily basis. She expresses herself through screaming, and what appear to
be aggressive outbursts. The care home is trying to access help from outside
agencies to explore the reasons behind this behaviour and is looking at how
the environment might be altered to reduce this distressing behaviour. In the
meantime, other residents, particularly those with dementia, are becoming
distressed and, in some cases, threatening to be violent towards her. There is
an identified risk of harm to the resident and to others.

One manager gave an illustrative dilemma of a large female resident who used
a wheelchair to get around the home and who was adamant that she wished to
leave the home unescorted. Outside the home was a large hill, and the manager
feared that the resident would lose control of the wheelchair and cause a serious
accident to herself or others. The resident was aware of the risk that she was
taking, but the manager struggled with the idea of simply allowing the resident
to leave on her own, even though she recognised that ultimately the resident was
able to make an informed choice.

      Mr Townsend had to be physically restrained because he attacked a member of
staff and one of the residents. He had to be physically removed from the scene
and taken to his room because of the high risk of continued violence. The MCA
Code of Practice, section 6.43 would support staff with these actions. Under
common law staff are able to take appropriate and necessary action to restrain or
remove the person, in order to prevent harm, both to that person and to anyone
else.
